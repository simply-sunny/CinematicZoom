## Supported versions

| Minecraft | Mod version | Java |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.20.1 | 1.3 | 17+ |
| 1.21.1 | 1.3 | 21+ |
| 1.21.2–1.21.4 | 1.3 | 21+ |
| 1.21.5–1.21.6 | 1.3 | 21+ |
| 1.21.7–1.21.8 | 1.3 | 21+ |
| 1.21.9–1.21.11 | 1.3 | 21+ |
| 26.1–26.1.2 | 1.3 | 25+ |
| 26.2–26.2.2 | 1.3 | 25+ |
| 26.3 | 1.3 | 25+ |

All ports live on `main`. The Gradle build keeps shared logic in common source sets and adds only the API-specific classes required by each Minecraft version.

## Building

The complete build requires JDK 25 because the `26.x` targets use Java 25 bytecode. Minecraft 1.20.1 is compiled with `--release 17`, while the 1.21.x targets use `--release 21`.

Build every supported version:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean buildAll
```

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
./gradlew clean buildAll
```

The nine release JARs are collected in `build/libs/`. Range builds include the
full supported interval in the filename, for example
`cinematiczoom-1.21.2-1.21.4-1.2.jar`.

Build only one target when developing:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :1.20.1:build
.\gradlew.bat :1.21.7:build
.\gradlew.bat :26.2:build
.\gradlew.bat '-PonlyTarget=26.3' ':26.3:build'
```

Per-version build output is also available under `versions/<minecraft-version>/build/libs/`.

Run the headless regression checks with `./gradlew test`. They exercise the real
zoom state, config migration, and wheel logic with stubbed Minecraft/Fabric APIs;
they do not launch the game or validate runtime mixin application. `buildAll` also
runs these checks.

## Project layout

- `src/common` — Java code shared by every target.
- `src/main/resources` — assets and translations shared by every target.
- `src/legacy` — shared Yarn-based code for Minecraft `1.20.1–1.21.11`.
- `src/legacy-pre-1.21.11` — legacy key-binding API used before `1.21.9`.
- `src/legacy-double-fov` — double-precision FOV API used by `1.20.1` and `1.21.1`.
- `src/legacy-float-fov` — FOV signature used by `1.21.2–1.21.11`.
- `src/legacy-render-tick-counter` — HUD render API used by `1.21.x`.
- `src/modern` — shared unobfuscated API code for Minecraft `26.x`.
- `src/modern-pre-26.3` and `src/modern-26.3` — version-specific key input APIs.
- `src/modern-post-26.1` — zoom manager shared by Minecraft `26.2` and `26.3`.
- `versions/<version>` — metadata and Java classes for each exact or range build target.
- `build.gradle` — the single version/dependency matrix and all build configuration.

## Features

- Hold-to-zoom (default key: `C`, rebindable).
- Separate rebindable keybindings for zooming with bars and zooming without bars (with hold and toggle support) in Minecraft Controls settings.
- Configurable starting zoom from 1× to 30× by default; 1× shows the cinematic bars without magnification. Custom config limits are respected by the settings screen.
- Proportional mouse sensitivity scaling during zoom for precise aim and control.
- View bobbing removal while zooming to eliminate screen shake when moving.
- Configurable zoom in and zoom out animation speeds and easing curves.
- Configurable animated black bars.
- Optional mouse-wheel zoom adjustment (with optional discrete/linear magnification stepping).
- Optional HUD/crosshair hiding.
- Optional cinematic camera while zooming.
- English and Russian translations.
- Mod Menu and Cloth Config integration.

## Installation

1. Install Fabric Loader and Fabric API for your Minecraft version.
2. Put the matching CinematicZoom JAR in the `mods` folder.
3. Optionally install Mod Menu and Cloth Config for the in-game configuration screen.
